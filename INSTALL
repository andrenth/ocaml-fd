                                ~~~~~~~~

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
==========================

These instructions assume you have gcc, make, OCaml and OCaml-findlib
installed.


Building:
---------

To build ocaml-fd, simply type "make" in this directory. This will build
the bytecode library. If you also want the natively-compiled library,
you should also run "make allopt".


Installing:
-----------

To install ocaml-fd, simply type "make install" in this directory.


Documentation:
--------------

Documentation generated by ocamldoc can be created by typing "make doc"
in this directory. The HTML files will reside in the "doc" directory.


Tests:
------

You can build the test program by running "make test", for the bytecode
version, or "make testopt" for the native version. This will generate
two executables in test/ml, namely "mycat" and "openfile". When run as
"./mycat some_file", it will fork and call "openfile", which will open
the given file and send its descriptor to its parent, using the
functions provided by the Fd module. More details can be found in
the comments in test/ml/mycat.ml.
